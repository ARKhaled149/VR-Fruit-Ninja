# VR-Fruit-Ninja

## "Slice your way into VR development – one fruit at a time!"

### Project Description

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) demo game built using Unity and Meta’s All-In-One XR SDK and Interaction SDK. The main idea was to get familiar with Meta’s VR tools and explore how to create simple yet interactive VR mechanics. In this demo, fruits are spawned and thrown toward the player, and the player can use virtual swords to slice them. The player grabs the swords using their hands or controllers and cuts the fruits as they approach. There’s no scoring or other mechanics – it’s purely a demo project designed to learn the basics of VR development and interaction.

### Process

The project followed a simple setup process since it was based on a YouTube tutorial. I started by setting up Unity for VR development by importing Meta’s All-In-One XR SDK and Interaction SDK. With the tools configured, I focused on implementing the core features.

First, I set up the interaction system, allowing the player to grab the swords using their hands or controllers. This was achieved using the grab interaction features provided by Meta’s SDK. Then, I added a fruit-spawning system, where the fruits are launched toward the player in the environment. Once the fruits were set up, I added slicing mechanics so that when the swords interact with the fruits, the fruits are “cut” as part of the demo.

Finally, I tested the project to ensure the interactions felt smooth and that the core mechanics (grabbing swords and cutting fruit) worked as expected. Since this was a simple demo, there wasn’t much fine-tuning needed, but the testing helped ensure that the basic interactions were functional.

### Results

The final product is a small VR demo designed to showcase basic interaction mechanics using Meta’s SDKs. Players can grab virtual swords with their hands or controllers and slice fruits as they are thrown toward them. The project doesn’t include advanced features like scoring, locomotion, or detailed mechanics – it’s purely a hands-on exercise to explore how to use Meta’s tools to create basic VR interactions.

This project provided me with a great introduction to Meta’s All-In-One XR SDK and Interaction SDK. It helped me understand how to set up a VR environment, use grab interactions, and implement simple mechanics like object slicing. While it’s a small demo, it’s a great example of learning the fundamentals of VR development and serves as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
